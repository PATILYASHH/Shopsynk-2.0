## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Build Fails?
1. Check environment variables are set correctly
2. Verify all dependencies are in package.json
3. Check build logs for specific error messages

### Routes Not Working?
- The _redirects file and netlify.toml handle SPA routing
- All routes will serve index.html for client-side routing

### Environment Variables Not Working?
- Ensure they start with `VITE_` prefix

- Redeploy after adding variables
