# Dashboard Navigation Improvements

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed "Add Transaction" Button from Desktop
- The "Add Transaction" button is now only visible on mobile devices (`sm:hidden`)
- Desktop users can access transactions through:
  - Clickable transactions card
  - Navigation sidebar
  - Recent activity "View All" button

### 2. Made Stats Cards Interactive
- **Suppliers Card**: Now clickable and redirects to `/suppliers`
  - Hover effect: Blue border and background
  - Better visual feedback for user interaction
  
- **Transactions Card**: Now clickable and redirects to `/transactions`
  - Hover effect: Green border and background
  - Provides quick access to add/view transactions

### 3. Improved User Experience
- **Desktop**: Clean dashboard without cluttered action buttons
- **Mobile**: Maintains quick access button for adding transactions
- **Navigation**: Intuitive card-based navigation for key features
- **Visual Feedback**: Hover states indicate clickable elements

## Benefits
